### SQL Schema
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Person;
Create table Person 
(
    Id int, 
    Email varchar(255)
    );
#Truncate table Person
insert into Person  values ('1', 'a@b.com'), ('2', 'c@d.com'), ('3', 'a@b.com');



`Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.`


#Solution1: # Using AGGREGATE FUNCTION COUNT the occurance of the Email in the column.

SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email) >1;




# Solution2:      # Using Inner Join to compare records that has the same email with different Id Number.
SELECT DISTINCT P1.Email
FROM Person P1
INNER JOIN Person P2
WHERE P1.Email = P2.Email AND P1.Id != P2.Id;
